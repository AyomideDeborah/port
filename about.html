          <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
         
            Hello! My name is Yusuf Ayomide Deborah. I am a very simple person. I don't have a lot of hobbies but I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. I am studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering in the University of Ilorin and I am in my third year.</p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about Software Development. I am now looking for a junior dev position as I recently learned how to code by myself.
         I started my journey as a developer after I left secondary school. I had a gap year and an uncle introduced me to HTML, and once that happened, I was completely hooked to the world of computers.
         </p>

         Lately, I’ve discovered my passion for the world of web development and the beauty behind building useful websites like the one you will find in this portfolio. I’m now looking for a junior dev position to finally kick start my career and learn among professionals.
        </p>
