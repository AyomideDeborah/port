            Hello! My name is Yusuf Ayomide Deborah. I am a very simple person. I don't have a lot of hobbies but I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. I learned early as a child that I can be anything, so that is just what I am doing....being anything I want. I am an aspiring Electrical Engineer, and a Junior developer. </p>
        <p>
         My journey as a developer started after my secondary education, when a friend introduced me to it. It felt like I just discovered a whole new world, and I immediately fell in love. Due to circumstances, a lot of free time fell on my side, and I have been completely hooked to the world of computers.
         </p>
        <p>
         I now have an ever growing passion for the world of web development and the beauty behind building useful websites like the one you will find in my portfolio. The perfect junior developer job is what I am looking forward to now. 
        </p>
        <p>
         Here are a few technolgies I've been working on recently:
         <ul>
          <li>Javascript</li>
          <li>Bootstrap</li>
          <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>SASS</li>
         </ul>
        </p>
